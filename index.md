# What is Recall?

**Recall** is an extension of Microsoft's Visual Studio Code to help you remember stuff using [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition){:target="_blank"}.

It creates flashcards directly from your Markdown notes and let's you test yourself repeatedly to maximize your memory retention. This can be usefull when learning a new language, taking a course on a particular subject, remembering jokes or pretty much anything else you want to remember. The choice is yours ðŸ˜‰

# Why use it?

Spaced repetition using flashcards is one of the most effective methods to memorize things. However, creating them takes too much time and extra effort.
**Recall** makes it super-easy by auto-detecting flashcards directly in your Markdown notes.
